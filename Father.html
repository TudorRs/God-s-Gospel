    <h1>God, the Eternal Creator</h1>

      <h2>The Eternal God</h2>
      <p>"Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." – <b>Psalm 90:2</b></p>
      <p>God exists beyond time and space. He has no beginning and no end, and all of creation finds its source in Him. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last. He transcends human understanding, yet chooses to reveal Himself to humanity in love, mercy, and power. He is constant and unchanging, a firm foundation throughout generations. His eternal nature brings comfort, knowing that His promises are unshakable and His presence everlasting.</p>
      <p>Throughout Scripture, we see God's timeless nature contrasted with our fleeting lives. In <b>Isaiah 40:28</b>, it says, "The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary." His eternity is not passive, but active — sustaining all things by His will and wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block fade-in">
      <h2>God’s Acts of Creation</h2>
      <p>"Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness." – <b>Genesis 1:3-4</b></p>
      <p>God spoke the universe into existence. Across six days, He created light, sky, land, vegetation, celestial bodies, animals, and finally mankind. On the seventh day, He rested, sanctifying it. The order and design of creation reflect His wisdom and intentionality. Every detail, from the stars in the sky to the cells in our body, shows His craftsmanship and glory.</p>
      <p>Creation was not chaotic or random, but beautiful and purposeful. The rhythm of creation — light from darkness, sea from land, order from void — displays a divine structure. In Job 38–41, God describes the majesty of His creation in poetic detail, reminding Job and all of us that His works are far beyond our comprehension.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block fade-in">
      <h2>The Creator and Mankind</h2>
      <p>"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea... So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." – <b>Genesis 1:26-27</b></p>
      <p>Humans were created to reflect God's nature: to be capable of love, reason, creativity, and stewardship. God's relationship with humanity is foundational to the story of salvation and purpose. From the Garden of Eden to the resurrection of Christ, God's desire has always been to dwell with His people.</p>
      <p>Being made in God's image means we have inherent value and dignity. It also means we are called to mirror His character — to be just, loving, and merciful. In Psalm 8, David asks, "What is man that You are mindful of him?" Yet God crowns mankind with glory and entrusts us with creation. This divine partnership is a gift and a responsibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block fade-in">
      <h2>God in History</h2>
      <p>Throughout the Bible, God reveals Himself to individuals, families, and nations — from Abraham to Moses, from prophets to kings. His covenant with Israel, the giving of the Law, the miracles in Egypt, and the exile and return all reflect His justice, mercy, and sovereign will.</p>
      <p>"I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery." – <b>Exodus 20:2</b></p>
      <p>God's actions in history are not abstract but deeply personal and transformative. He calls Abraham to leave everything and promises to bless all nations through him. He sends Moses to confront Pharaoh and deliver His people through signs and wonders. He raises up judges, prophets, and kings to guide, correct, and redeem His people.</p>
      <p>Even in judgment, God offers hope. The exile of Israel was painful, but God promised restoration. Through the prophet Jeremiah, He declares, "For I know the plans I have for you... plans to give you a future and a hope." God's faithfulness endures even when His people falter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block fade-in">
      <h2>Names and Nature</h2>
      <p>God is called Yahweh, meaning "I AM WHO I AM" — self-existent and unchanging. He is El Elyon (God Most High), El Roi (The God Who Sees), and Jehovah-Jireh (The Lord Will Provide). Each name expresses His character and His role in the lives of His people.</p>
      <p>These names are not mere titles but revelations of how God interacts with us. El Shaddai, "God Almighty," shows His power to bless and protect. Jehovah-Rapha, "The Lord Who Heals," reveals His care for our brokenness. Jehovah-Nissi, "The Lord Is My Banner," reminds us He leads us in battle and gives us victory.</p>
      <p>Knowing God's names helps us know His heart. He is not distant, but present — a refuge in times of trouble, a shepherd in times of wandering, a Father in times of need. As we draw near to Him, we begin to understand the fullness of His holiness, love, and grace.</p>
